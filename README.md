# Superlists
A to-do website written in Python using Django.

The development of Superlists follows the Test-Driven Development methodology, such as writing unit tests prior to (incremental) changes and test automation.

List data is held in a SQLite database. Test automation is achieved through a mixture of unittest, the Django test framework, and Selenium.
